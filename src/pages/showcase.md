## Anime to Real life

This is my first art project. I made this because I love the Ginko character from the Mushishi Anime, which is based around 19th-century technology with Japan still as a "closed country". Here i present a simple way to bring Ginko back to these beautiful modern landscapes. Enjoy x ! 
### Welcome to Modern Japan, Ginko
