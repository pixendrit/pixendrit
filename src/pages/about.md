## Hello World

```css

// We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

    .bio {

    I started recently creating pixel arts and websites, but I have worked as
    a freelance graphic designer for 5 years. 
    Most of my pixel works are new and present as illustration or motion graphics.
    I create both original works, fan arts and also collaborated projects 
    with friends, colleagues etc.
